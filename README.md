Please imagine that you are working for an international team and you are asked to develop an object management app whose requirements are explained below. When implementing the requirements below, please bear in mind that even though it is a simple app, this can be reviewed or further developed by other colleagues. 

    The goal is to create a user interface for an object management software.
    An object could be a desk, computer, keyboard, server or human
    In the main screen you can search for the name or description of an object (quick search, e.g. auto-complete).
    Objects can have the following attributes: Name, description, type
    The following functions should be possible
        Create/edit/delete objects
        Create/edit/delete relations between objects
    All data can be stored in the browser's cache (WebStorage)
    Special emphasis is placed on usability
    If possible, the software should be created with the following programming languages in mind: Typescript with React, HTML and CSS. We also usually use React context provider for your information.
    Extensive Javascript libraries should be avoided
    Cloud services can be used as a platform for providing a test application: Amazon AWS / Microsoft Azure
    When selecting the platform, GUI, etc., please choose the one you feel more comfortable with and let us know why you decided to use it.
    Delivery within 48 hours after receipt at the latest (if you need more time, please just let us know)

    Please include comments in your code

Please return one link to download/review your code + a test link where we can see the application working. Please just copy the URLs in your next message and send it as a reply to this email.
